I have been trying to get the NeoPixel library to work in the Arduino IDE 1.6.6, but I am having no luck. I am using a Pro Trinket 5V 16MHz with the Adafruit NeoPixel library.

I am having the same problem. I am using Arduino 1.6.6 on a Mac. I am having the same problem. I am using Arduino 1.6.6 on a Mac.

I can't get it to work either. It compiles fine, but the sketch won't upload.
