1. Create a separate Python module called `openai_api.py` that contains functions related to making requests to the OpenAI API. This will help separate the concerns of the code by removing the API request related code from `upload_to_openai()` and making it easier to maintain.

2. Create a separate Python module called `file_utils.py` that contains functions related to manipulating and reading files. This will help separate the concerns of the code by removing the file related code from `upload_to_openai()` and making it easier to maintain.

3. Move the `config` module import from the top of the file to inside the `upload_to_openai()` function so it is only imported when the function is called. This will help improve maintainability and reduce clutter.

4. Split up the `upload_to_openai()` function into smaller functions, each focused on a single task such as loading the API key, reading the file contents, and making the API requests. This will make the code more readable and easier to maintain.

5. Wrap the API request code in a `try/except` block to handle unexpected errors.
