1. Separate out the "getting the file's current state" into a separate function, for example `get_github_file_state()`.
2. Separate out the "updating or creating the file" into a separate function, for example `update_or_create_github_file()`.
3. Create a "helper" function to encode the content of the file into base64.
4. Move the URL parameters, such as `repo_owner`, `repo_name`, etc. into a separate object or dictionary, as to make the code more readable and maintainable.
5. Create a logging function to log error messages and responses from the API calls.
6. Add error handling to the code, such as try/catch blocks, to handle errors gracefully.
7. Create a function to handle the response from the API, to make sure that the response code is valid and that the content is not empty.
8. Add comments to the code to explain the purpose of each function, as well as any tricky parts.
