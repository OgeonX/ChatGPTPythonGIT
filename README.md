OpenAI Code Suggestions
This script uses the OpenAI API to suggest improvements to Python code files in the current directory, and uploads the modified code to a specified GitHub repository.

Getting Started
To use this script, you'll need an OpenAI API key and a GitHub personal access token with "repo" scope. These should be stored in a .env file in the project root directory:

makefile
Copy code
OPENAI_API_KEY=<your OpenAI API key>
GITHUB_API_KEY=<your GitHub personal access token>
GITHUB_REPO_OWNER=<GitHub repository owner>
GITHUB_REPO_NAME=<GitHub repository name>
You'll also need to install the required Python packages:

Copy code
pip install requests
pip install python-dotenv
Usage
To run the script, simply navigate to the directory containing the Python code files you want to improve, and run:

css
Copy code
python main.py
The script will output suggestions and modified code for each Python file in the directory, and upload the modified code to the specified GitHub repository.

Error Handling
The script includes several measures to handle errors gracefully:

If the OpenAI or GitHub API keys are invalid, the script will print an error message and exit.
If an error occurs while making an API request, the script will log the error and continue processing other files.
If a file in the directory is not a Python file, the script will skip it and continue processing other files.
Logging
The script logs errors and successful uploads to a file named app.log in the project root directory.
