1. Extract the logic of cloning the GitHub repository into a separate function, with git_repo_url and tmp_dir as parameters.
2. Extract the logic of clearing the temporary directory into a separate function, with tmp_dir as a parameter.
3. Replace the os.system call with a library that provides more control over the git clone operation, such as GitPython.
4. Replace the shutil.rmtree call with a library that provides more control over file operations, such as Pathlib.
5. Split the function into two separate ones, one for cloning and one for returning the temporary directory path.
6. Add logging to the code in order to track the status of the cloning operation.
