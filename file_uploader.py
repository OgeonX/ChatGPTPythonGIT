1. Separate the file uploading logic from the request logic. Create a separate function for making the request and for uploading the file. 
2. Move the endpoint URL out of the function and into a constant, so that it can easily be updated. 
3. Move the headers dictionary out of the function and into a constant, so that the authorization key can easily be updated. 
4. Move the file data dictionary out of the function and into a constant, so that the purpose is easily updated. 
5. Add logging to the function to help debug any errors that might occur. 
6. Extract out the error handling logic into its own function, so that it can be easily reused. 
7. Extract out the response handling logic into its own function, so that it can be easily reused. 
8. Rename the function to make it more meaningful, such as 'make_file_upload_request'. 
9. Add parameter validation to the function to make sure that the correct parameters are provided. 
10. Use the os.path module to handle the file path rather than manually constructing the path.
