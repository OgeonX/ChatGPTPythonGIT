1. Create a separate function to determine the endpoint URL based on the API key type. This will make it easier to maintain the code if different API endpoints need to be added in the future.

2. Move the code to make the GET request and check the response status code into a separate function. This will make it easier to test the code and improve readability.

3. Move the code to set the GET request parameters into a separate function. This will make it easier to test the code and improve readability.

4. Create a separate function to print error messages when the API key test fails. This will make it easier to maintain the code if different error messages need to be added in the future.
